# Shibagen
A Roblox account generator that uses Selenium for the user to solve the FunCaptcha themselves, while Shibagen does everything else.
This makes creating lots of Roblox accounts for your own purposes easier, although not completely automated.

### Issues?
If there's a bug, send an Issue request with the error using proper formatting, putting your error inside of a code block, and what OS you are running on.

### Want to help improve?
I'm an amateur at releasing Python scripts to the public and all of my Python knowledge comes from self-learning by using Google and looking at other scripts. If you think something is a mess, I welcome you to improve it by sending a pull request, or you can fork this repository and make this project your own.
